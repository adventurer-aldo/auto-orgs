So there are 4 types of timings.
Immediate - Played right after the !play command
Tallied - Played right after the votes are tallied
Idoled - Played right after the idols are played
Super - Played after the votes are read

The way it works is as follows. You have a !play command, which args is the item code. Afterwards
you get a list of targets. Afterwards, that is done.
If you use the !play command again, it cancels out.
The way that is known is if the targets array has (0) or (> 0) items, which decides if no or yes targets.

So, what happens exactly when an item is played?
First, there must be a method so that it cannot be used again. That is simple. Remove the user as an owner.
Though, there's other thing. What if it can be found again? Simple. Make sure the owner is not nil. If 
owner is nil, then the item can be found.

Afterwards, once an item is played, its owner is changed to no one, right after its effects applying.
Which means that when an extra vote is played, it adds 1 to allowed_votes then kills itself.
Except, that effect only happens when the timing is due. Like, immediate -> kills immediately.
tallied -> kills when votes are tallied

So, item has timing and function code. if timing is immediate, call function code and erase item.
otherwise, the count command will call the function in its appropriated times. no, not erase item.
Change its owner to 0.

Also, about clues...
ah yes, the find command. although, a find command kinda...doesn't jive right now.
